<div class = "info_BMI" > <P>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health problems, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual.
	BMI does not measure body fat directly, but BMI is moderately correlated with more direct measures of body fat 1,2,3. Furthermore, BMI appears to be as strongly correlated with various metabolic and disease outcome as are these more direct measures of body fatness

<br>
<h2>How is BMI used?</h2>
<br>
<p>BMI can be a screening tool, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual. To determine if BMI is a health risk, a healthcare provider performs further assessments. Such assessments include skinfold thickness measurements, evaluations of diet, physical activity, and family history10.</p>
<br>
<h2>What are the BMI trends for adults</h2>
<br>
<p>The prevalence of adult BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2 (obese status) has greatly increased since the 1970s. Recently, however, this trend has leveled off, except for older women. Obesity has continued to increase in adult women who are age 60 years and older.</p>

<br>
<h2>Why is BMI used to measure overweight and obesity?</h2>
<br>
<p>Because calculation requires only height and weight, BMI is an inexpensive and easy tool. To see the formula based on either kilograms and meters or pounds and inches</p>
<br>
<h2>How is BMI interpreted for adults?</h2>
<br>
<p>For adults 20 years old and older, BMI is interpreted using standard weight status categories. These categories are the same for men and women of all body types and ages.</p>
<br>
<p><b>The standard weight status categories associated with BMI ranges for adults are shown in the following table.</b></p>
<!-- TABLE_1 -->
<!-- <div class = "table_1"></div><img src="BMI_table.png" alt=""> -->



<p>For example, here are the weight ranges, the corresponding BMI ranges, and the weight status categories for a person who is 5′ 9″.</p><br>
<!-- TABLE_2 -->
<h2>How good is BMI as an indicator of body fatness?</h2><br>
<p>The correlation between the BMI and body fatness is fairly strong1,2,3,7, but even if two people have the same BMI, their level of body fatness may differ12.</p>
<br>
<p>In general,<br>
	●	At the same BMI, women tend to have more body fat than men.   <br>
	●	At the same BMI, Blacks have less body fat than do Whites13,14, and Asians have more body fat than do Whites15.  <br>
	●	At the same BMI, older people, on average, tend to have more body fat than younger adults. <br>
	●	At the same BMI, athletes have less body fat than do non-athletes.
